# This Python script is the entry point for your web service. It uses the FastAPI 
# framework to create a web server that exposes your ADK (Agent Development Kit) agent,
# making it accessible over HTTP.
# 
# What does this file do: 
# 1 Creates a FastAPI server with ADK integration
# 2 Enables the web interface for testing
# 3 Provides health check endpoints
